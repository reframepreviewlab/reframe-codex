## Open Questions for Review
1. Who is the accountable owner for each milestone?
2. What target dates are feasible for planning, execution, and validation passes?
3. Which top 1–3 deliverables should be committed for the next sprint?

## Risks and Blockers
- Prior context from the shared conversation is not directly accessible in this environment.
- Owner and timeline fields are still TBD, reducing accountability and forecast confidence.
